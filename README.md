 README for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Data Analysis

 Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Data Analysis

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and survival rate analysis of a fictional dataset simulating data from a clinical trial of 222 breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The goal is to identify key predictors and trends that influence clinical outcomes, with a focus on baseline tumor size, age, hormone receptor status, and survival rates.

Project Overview

The primary objective of this analysis is to explore predictive factors that influence clinical outcomes for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. By examining this dataset, we aim to identify key predictors, such as demographic and clinical characteristics, that significantly impact treatment efficacy.

 Dataset

The dataset includes information from 222 breast cancer patients, sourced from the Cancer Imaging Archive and the Breast Imaging Research Program at UCSF, in collaboration with ACRIN, CALGB, the I-SPY Trial, and TCIA. It contains both clinical data and MRI measurements, along with key outcome variables such as survival status and residual cancer burden.

Key Components

Data Wrangling and Cleaning

- Importing, inspecting, and cleaning the dataset.
- Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- Creating new features, such as age groups and relative tumor size reduction.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Age Group Distribution:** Visualization and analysis of age group distribution among participants.
- **Baseline Tumor Size Distribution:** Histogram and boxplot visualization of baseline tumor sizes before chemotherapy.
- **Scatter Plot of Age vs. Baseline Tumor Size:** Correlation analysis between age and baseline tumor size.
- **Scatter Plot of Baseline Tumor Size vs. Relative Tumor Size Reduction:** Investigation of the relationship between initial tumor size and reduction in tumor size post-treatment.
- **Demographic and Clinical Factors Distribution:** Analysis of race, estrogen receptor status, and residual cancer burden distribution.
- **Box Plots Grouped by PCR:** Comparison of age and baseline tumor sizes between patients who achieved PCR and those who did not.

 Survival Rate Analysis

- Calculation and visualization of survival and death rates.
- Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis.

Key Findings

 Significant Predictors

- **Baseline Tumor Size:** Most participants had tumor sizes between 50 and 75 units.
- **Age:** Middle-aged participants, particularly those in the 40-49 and 50-59 age ranges, were overrepresented.
- **Estrogen Receptor Status:** 98 participants were ER-positive, which is crucial for predicting treatment response.

Trends and Patterns

- **Right-Skewed Tumor Size Distribution:** Indicates a predominance of smaller tumors.
- **High Survival Rate:** 80.95%, suggesting the overall effectiveness of the chemotherapy regimen.
- **Variable Residual Cancer Burden:** Highlights differing degrees of treatment response among participants.

 Implications for Treatment

These findings suggest the importance of considering multiple factors, including baseline tumor size, age, and hormone receptor status, for patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. The variability in residual cancer burden emphasizes the need for tailored treatment strategies to improve outcomes for all patient subgroups.

 Limitations and Future Directions

 Study Limitations

- **Sample Size:** May not be large enough to generalize findings.
- **Lack of Detailed Racial Information:** Limits the ability to assess treatment disparities.
- **Potential Biases:** Data collection and reporting biases could affect reliability.

 Future Research

- **Incorporating Additional Biomarkers:** Enhance predictive models and understanding of chemotherapy response.
- **Exploring Other Predictors:** Investigate genetic markers and patient health status for more comprehensive predictive models.

 Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into factors influencing treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and suggests areas for further research and clinical improvement.
